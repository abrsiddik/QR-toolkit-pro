🗺️ QR Toolkit Pro — Future Roadmap
Current Version v1.5 (Responsive, Themed, API-based)


🟢 PHASE 1 — THE TRUE OFFLINE UPDATE (Next Priority)
Goal Remove dependency on the external goqr.me API to ensure 100% privacy and offline functionality.

⚡ Client-Side Generation Replace the API call with a JavaScript library (like qrcode.js or qrious) embedded directly into the file.

🏎️ Zero Latency QR codes generate instantly (0ms) as you type, with no network request.

💾 SVG Support Allow downloading as Vector (SVG) for print professionals, not just PNG.

Why this matters Currently, if the user loses internet, the app stops generating. Moving logic to the browser makes it bulletproof.



🟡 PHASE 2 — APP-IFICATION (PWA)
Goal Make the tool installable on iOS and Android.

📱 Web Manifest Embed a manifest.json (as a Data URI) to define the app name, icons, and theme color.

🏠 Home Screen Install Allow users to Add to Home Screen to launch it fullscreen without the browser address bar.

🛑 Offline Service Worker Cache the HTML file so it loads instantly even in Airplane Mode.



🔵 PHASE 3 — DATA EXPANSION
Goal Support niche and power-user use cases.

📅 Event QR Add .ics  Calendar event support (Title, Date, Location).

₿ Crypto BitcoinEthereum wallet address formatting.

💬 Social Pre-filled WhatsApp and Telegram message links.

📍 Geo-Location Open specific coordinates in GoogleApple Maps.

🔢 Bulk Generation (Advanced) Upload a CSV list of names - Download a ZIP of QR codes.



🟣 PHASE 4 — THE SCANNER UPDATE
Goal Close the loop (Create & Read).

📷 Camera Access Add a Scan tab that opens the device camera.

🖼️ Image Scan Upload a screenshot of a QR code to decode it.

🔗 History Integration Scanned codes get saved to the same History tab as generated ones.

Note This requires a larger library (like html5-qrcode), which challenges the Single File constraint but is possible via CDN.



🔴 PHASE 5 — DESIGNER SUITE
Goal Aesthetic controls for branding professionals.

🎨 Gradient QRs Instead of solid black, allow gradient fills on the QR data modules.

🟢 Dot Styles Change squares to dots, rounded corners, or diamonds.

👁️ Eye Customization Color the 3 corner eyes differently than the data dots.

🖼️ Frame Gallery Add Scan Me frames around the QR code.

🧠 TECHNICAL DEBT & MAINTENANCE
To keep the project healthy as you scale

Code Splitting (Conceptual) Even though it is one file, keep CSS, JS, and HTML clearly commented and sectioned (as I have done).

Asset Management If you add many icons or libraries, consider using a build tool that compiles into a single HTML file, rather than editing a 2000-line HTML file manually.

Local Storage Limits Monitor history size. If users generate images, localStorage will fill up. Stick to saving text data only.
